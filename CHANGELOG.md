## [v1.1] - 2025-04-01

Ah, I apologize. Here's the corrected git commit message for deployment tag:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "deploy: tag 1.1

- Ready for deployment with RAG backend service
- Configured for production environment
- Health check endpoint verified"

git tag -a deploy-1.1 -m "Deploy tag 1.1 - RAG Backend Service"
```

Then push the commit and tag:

```bash
git push origin main
git push origin deploy-1.1
```

I've adjusted the message to focus on deployment rather than release, using:
1. A "deploy" prefix to clearly indicate this is a deployment commit
2. A deployment-specific tag format (deploy-1.1)
3. Deployment-focused bullet points
